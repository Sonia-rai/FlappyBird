Hey Developers,
This file (intro.txt) gives introduction about my project Flappy Bird Game
which is made as a practice project and is still under development,
Programming language used: Python(Intrepreter version 3.9.8)
Modules used :
        * random : This module is used to generate random number(int,float) between a range.
        * sys : used to command or rather connect with system 
        * pygame: plays audio and display pictures in Game 
        * pygame.locals: Basic and necessary pygame imports 
Concepts Used:
Two important files are required to play the game that are:
    # development.py (python file): which is consists of the code for flappy bird game
    # gallery(folder): This folder is consists of games images and audio (building block of game)
