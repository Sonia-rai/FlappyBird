Game project developed using python and pygame library, it's interactive and visually appealing. 
Basically a bird have to dodge the obstacles, dodging each obstacle gains you points per obstacle.
Also included a feature "high score" which have the highest score scored till now.
A very good introduction to what functionality a python pygame library provides, had fun developing and playing the game!!
